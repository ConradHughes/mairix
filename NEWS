NEW IN VERSION 0.2
==================

* Substrings of message paths can be used as search expressions (p:substring
  option)

* = now used instead of / as the delimiter for number of errors in an
  approximate match (to help with path search)

* Bug fix when using -t mode for search with unpurged dead messages still in
  the database.
